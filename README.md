# ConTeXt Runtime Library

## About ConTeXt
ConTeXt is a TeX macro-package for creating rich and complex PDF documents. It was created by Hans Hagen of Pragma ADE.

## About Project
This is a project meant to provide process management for the ConTeXt macro-package. Eventually, this library should enable the implementation of:

* Client desktop and mobile applications that perform live preview as a ConTeXt file is being edited
* WYSIWYG-style editor for ConTeXt (like Lyx)
